<!--## What is Prusa?

## Why Prusa?

I also had some experience using the machine, while building Malta International Airport Model.

## The assembly:
The printer is delivered in a box as a kit, and needs assembly. There are options to purchase it fully assembled, however it costs more. It is also a nice way to start understanding the printer.

It took a full-day to assemble, and you do need to assemble every little detail, including the extruder.

Here are some photographs during the built, taken every time the manual suggests taking Haribo Bears! (Included in the package)

I do not have photographs for the last steps, which included the assembly of electrical equipment.

After assembly, it only needed a calibration and started printing immediately.

Should you purchase one, I suggest that the first thing you'll print is parts for the printer itself. Some things may break (very unlikely to damage, but still good to have some extra parts). Attention: printing the extruder parts you will need PETG-BLACK and ideally from PRUSAMENT. I read this quite at a late stage, and I had already started printing my parts in PETG-GRAY. I selected the PETG-GRAY as I would keep a record for the parts that have been replaced, if any.-->

Here is a list of prints, and their allotted time.
