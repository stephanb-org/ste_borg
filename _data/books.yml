        description: "“O’Neil’s book offers a frightening look at how algorithms are increasingly regulating people...Her knowledge of the power and risks of mathematical models, coupled with a gift for analogy, makes her one of the most valuable observers of the continuing weaponization of big data… [She] does a masterly job explaining the pervasiveness and risks of the algorithms that regulate our lives.” —New York Times Book Review"
