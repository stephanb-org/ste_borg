The architectural model is a tool often used to express a building design or masterplan. The model represents architectural ideas, and can be used at all stages of design. An architectural model shows the scale and physical presence of a proposed design.

I have been part of the team that built the Malta International Airport model, currently displayed for the public at the third floor building. Further than the challenges to scale, such a model has also researched a part for the lights.

The model is a 3 dimensional replica or expression of the design, usually at a scale much smaller than full size. Traditionally, architectural models were made exclusively by hand using materials such as foam board, balsa wood and card, but more recent developments in technologies have seen the use of digital methods such as laser cutting and 3D printing.

The architectural model can be seen in many forms, created out of a multitude of materials and traditional or modern techniques. These modern techniques now allow for faster and more detailed model production, with fast model making becoming a strong requirement.

Despite the development of 3D modelling and photo-realistic rendering, there is a still a firm place for the architectural model in the design process.

As a student, I have been asked a number of times to build models. it is likely you will be asked to build a model at least once, and it is a great skill to develop and embrace during your studies. Not only will architectural model making serve to improve your design critique, but give you new skills in critical thinking and spacial awareness.

### Roadmap
* Scale
* Materials
* Machinery
* Presentation
* Off-the-shelve material

Scale

Scale is where you start from

Machinery

Recently machinery has aided architecture model making greatly. In this article, I shall be introducing three important tools that may aid any model maker. Foam cutter, laser cutter and the 3D printer.
