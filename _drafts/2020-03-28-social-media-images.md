Summary:
- Profile photo: 180 x 180 pixels. Displays at 160 x 160, best results when uploading a square image (360×360, 720×720 or 960×960). The Facebook profile picture frame size is 183×183 pixels.

### Facebook Profile Photo Size

A profile picture is a square image that measures 168px by 168px on desktop. However, be aware that even though you’ll be uploading a square photo, it will be cropped into a circle.

Facebook also stores a higher resolution version at 320px by 320px.

The size of the profile picture that is seen in the comments you make, however, is scaled down and resized to a square image of 40px by 40px.

Lastly, if someone clicks on your profile photo, it can be displayed as large as 850px by 850px. The highest resolution Facebook will store is 2048px by 2048px.

When creating your profile picture, I recommend creating them at the highest resolution, 2048px by 2048px.

That will ensure that you are presenting the highest quality image for your most important Facebook asset—your profile picture. It’s how people will come to know you, so you want it to be good.

Down and dirty dimensions:

- Max size: 2048px by 2048px
- Minimum size: 168px by 168px
- Minimum recommended size: 761px by 761px
- Aspect ratio: 1:1



### Facebook Cover Photo Size

A Timeline cover photo measures 851px by 315px. This is the minimum size that Facebook will display the photo at.

However, if you’re viewing it on a mobile device with Retina Display or other high resolution displays (which most smartphones have nowadays) the actual display size is 1125px by 633px.

If you peek behind the source code, you find that Facebook is storing a higher resolution version, and the upper limit seems to be 2037px by 754px. So, if you want the highest resolution image use those dimensions.

Down and dirty dimensions:

- Maximum size: 2037px by 754px
- Minimum size: 851px by 315px
- Aspect ratio: 2.7:1

Facebook event photo sizes are different in various locations. The correct Facebook event cover photo size is 1920 x 1080 pixels with a 16:9 ratio. Wider images will have the sides cropped. Taller images will be cropped top and bottom. There are online Facebook event photo maker tools, but it’s really easy to resize image for Facebook event yourself.
