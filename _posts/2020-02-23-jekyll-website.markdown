**Portfolio.** Digital or Print? I have prepared drafts for a print portfolio for quite some time now, and have a good number of sketches of spreads. The process of creating a spread goes something like the following;

1. Images
2. Blueprints
3. Spreads

I had came across Jekyll recently, and decided to publish my portfolio online. Pressed for time, Jekyll came handy.

Online portfolios are increasingly common because many communication materials are digital. However, some employers may ask you to bring a hardcopy portfolio to the interview. Create an online portfolio, such as a professional website, so that the general public can see your work. Send the online portfolio to professional contacts in your network or to potential employers before the job interview so they can see your writing samples. As a precautionary measure, also print some of the writing samples and put them in a leather zip-up portfolio or a professional binder when youâ€™re preparing for the job interview.
