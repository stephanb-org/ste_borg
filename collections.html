Collections are a number of works that do not fall within the compilation of architectural design works displayed under the link 'projects'. Hereunder, is a curated list of works that I am particularly satisfied with that demonstrate a specific skillset in the medium of art and design.

  <ul class="posts" style="padding-top: 20px;">
    {% for collection in sorted %}
      <li><span>{{ collection.year }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ collection.url }}">{{ collection.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
