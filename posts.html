Articles topics range from 3D printing and laser cutting to architectural commentary and critique. I dabble in a bit of everything. I program software, write articles, sculpt things, paint things, carve things, learn things, design, assemble and build things. This is where I put all the stuff I want to share in a more permanent format.<br><br>

  <ul class="posts" style="padding-top: 20px;">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
